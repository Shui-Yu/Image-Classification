# Image-Classification

This repository includes four Jupyter notebooks regarding image classification of pipe damages. 

Original Dataset:
  - Training set:
  - Test set:

[01_cnn.ipynb](01_cnn.ipynb):
  - Constructed 4 Constructed a Convolutional Neural Network models
  - Improved model performance step by step conducting parameter tuning and adding regularization.
  - Obtained best model which has training accuracy 98.6% and test accuracy 83.1%
  
[02_cnn_with_data_augmentation.ipynb](02_cnn_with_data_augmentation.ipynb)
  - Implemented data augmentation by randomly applying width/height shift, brightness and channel shift
  - Resulted in doubline the training set size
  - Achieved train accuracy 100% and test accuracy: 88.7%
